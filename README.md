# damlab-skills

A collection of [Cursor AgentSkills](https://docs.cursor.com/agent/skills) for bioinformatics tools used in the DAM Lab. Each skill teaches the AI agent how to use a specific tool — its common patterns, invocation conventions, and full command reference.

## Skills

| Skill | Tool | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `samtools` | [samtools](https://www.htslib.org/) | SAM/BAM/CRAM alignment file manipulation |
| `seqkit` | [seqkit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/) | FASTA/FASTQ sequence manipulation |
| `csvtk` | [csvtk](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/csvtk/) | CSV/TSV tabular data manipulation |
| `pod5` | [pod5](https://github.com/nanoporetech/pod5-file-format) | POD5 nanopore raw signal file inspection, merging, filtering, subsetting, and conversion |
| `crispresso` | [CRISPResso2](https://docs.crispresso.com/) | CRISPR genome editing outcome analysis from amplicon sequencing (indels, HDR, base editing, prime editing) |
| `create-skill` | — | Meta-skill: conventions for adding new skills to this repo |
| `bioinfo-best-practices` | — | Meta-skill: workflow conventions for reproducible bioinformatics analysis and debugging |

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damlab/damlab-skills ~/repos/damlab-skills
cd ~/repos/damlab-skills
bash install.sh
```

`install.sh` does two things:
1. Creates a dedicated conda environment for each tool (e.g. `damlab-skill-samtools`) from the tool's `environment.yaml`
2. Symlinks each skill directory into `~/.cursor/skills/`

Restart Cursor after running — skills are auto-discovered from `~/.cursor/skills/`.

Running `install.sh` again on a new machine is safe: existing envs are skipped, symlinks are refreshed.

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/repos/damlab-skills
git pull
bash install.sh   # re-links any new skills; skips existing conda envs
```

To update a conda env to the latest tool version:
```bash
conda env remove -n damlab-skill-samtools
conda env create -f skills/samtools/environment.yaml
```

## Cursor Setup (`.cursor/mcp.json` not required)

Skills are loaded automatically by Cursor when placed in `~/.cursor/skills/`. No additional configuration is needed. The agent applies them based on the `description` field in each `SKILL.md`.

For project-level skills (shared via a repo), symlink into `.cursor/skills/` in the project root instead.

## Adding a new skill

Activate the `create-skill` skill in Cursor (it is symlinked alongside the tool skills) and ask the agent to add a new skill. The meta-skill contains all conventions for this repo.

Alternatively, follow the checklist in `create-skill/SKILL.md` manually.
